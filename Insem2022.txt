Q4.a. Consider the following schemes
 Supplier(SNO, Sname, Status, City)
 Parts (PNO, Pname, Color, Weight, City)
 Shipments(SNO,PNO,QTY)

SQL> CREATE TABLE Supplier
  2  (SNO int PRIMARY KEY,
  3  Sname varchar(20),
  4  Status varchar(20),
  5  City varchar(20));

Table created.

SQL> CREATE TABLE Parts
  2  (PNO int PRIMARY KEY,
  3  Pname varchar(20),
  4  Color varchar(20),
  5  Weight int,
  6  City varchar(20));

Table created.

SQL> CREATE TABLE Shipments
  2  (SNO int REFERENCES Supplier(SNO),
  3  PNO int REFERENCES Parts(PNO),
  4  QTY int);

Table created. 

Write SQL queries for the following:
 i. Find shipment information (SNO, Sname, PNO, Pname, QTY) for
 those having quantity less than 157.
 SELECT SNO, Sname, PNO, Pname, QTY
 FROM Supplier NATURAL JOIN Shipments NATURAL JOIN Parts
 WHERE QTY<157;

 ii. List SNO, Sname, PNO, Pname for those suppliers who made
 shipments of parts whose quantity is larger than the average quantity
 SELECT SNO, Sname, PNO, Pname
 FROM Supplier NATURAL JOIN Shipments NATURAL JOIN Parts
 WHERE QTY > (SELECT avg(QTY) FROM Shipments);

 iii. Find aggregate quantity of PNO 1692 of color green for which
 shipments made by supplier number who residing Mumbai
 SELECT SUM(QTY) FROM Shipments NATURAL JOIN Parts
 WHERE PNO=1692 and Color='Green' and City='Mumbai';
